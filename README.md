## 1. The strategic value gap

The Career Navigator is a premier tool for generating Labor Market Intelligence. However, its current architecture relies on a Diagnostic-First UX. From a Product Management perspective, this creates high friction for the user—the citizen, who must provide significant data (CVs, attitudes, skills) before receiving tangible value.

## 2. The target persona: mid-level professionals with informed anxiety

To bridge this gap, we must design for our highest-intent segment: individuals with informed anxiety.

**Profile:**

- Mid-level professionals (3–7 years experience) in sectors with high AI exposure
- They consume labour market news, but find the signal-to-noise ratio too low to drive meaningful action
- Digitally literate but lack the specialised technical depth or leadership moat to feel "replacement-proof"
- They want to ensure their market competitiveness but need a personalised, objective direction for their next skill investment

## 3. The future-oriented value proposition

By shifting the value proposition from skill assessment (past-oriented) to economic mobility and resilience (future-oriented), we can drastically increase voluntary data contributions.

This reframing will:

- Increase user willingness to access and share their employment and educational data
- Assure higher data density per user to power the Whiteshield Quantum Model

## 4. The 3-feature acquisition funnel

I propose a tactical pivot in the acquisition funnel through three low-overhead overlays, designed as low-overhead, high-impact overlays that incentivise user participation without requiring a structural UI overhaul.

| **Feature** | **Description** | **User Story** | **User Value** | **UX Mechanism** | **Product Goal** |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Automation Vulnerability Score** | A high-impact Market Risk meter comparing the user's role against national AI displacement trends. | "As an anxious professional, I want to see how my specific job title compares to national AI trends so I can stop guessing about my career risk." | Converts abstract AI trends into a personal risk assessment. | First-time user inputs Job Title → System generates a National Resilience Percentile vs. the cohort. | Reduces Time to Value (TTV) and lowers the bounce rate on the initial landing page. |
| **Resilience Boost Roadmap** | A personalised Gap-to-Growth visual analytical tool generated immediately following a CV upload. | "As a career optimiser, I want to see exactly which 3 skills will increase my market value so I can focus my learning on high-ROI activities." | Provides a clear, actionable path to economic mobility. | User uploads CV → Quantum Engine reveals the 3 specific skills that would move the user into the top 20% of Resilient professionals. | Drives CV upload volume and ensures high-fidelity skill data for the Quantum Model. |
| **Future-Ready Credential** | A verified, social-media-ready badge—"Certified Future-Ready Skills"—co-branded by Whiteshield and the client (GovMin). | "As a proactive worker, I want to share my verified Future-Ready skills with my network to signal my competence and readiness to recruiters." | Professional recognition and delight. | Post-analysis, users trigger a LinkedIn share in one click that lists their verified skills without exposing their risk score. | Create a Product-Led Growth (PLG) loop where user shares drive organic acquisition, reducing the cost of user recruitment. |

## 5. Measuring impact

To evaluate the success of this strategic pivot, we will monitor three North Star KPIs:

| **KPI** | **Definition** | **Why It Matters** |
|---------|----------------|--------------------|
| **CV Conversion Rate** | Click-Through Rate (CTR) from the Landing Page to the CV Upload prompt. | Indicates effectiveness of the initial value proposition in driving user engagement. |
| **Data Integrity Score** | Average number of unique skill-tags extracted per CV via the Quantum Engine. | Measures quality and completeness of user-contributed data, critical for LMI accuracy. |
| **K-Factor (Virality)** | Number of new signups attributed directly to organic LinkedIn referral links. | Demonstrates viral growth potential and reduces customer acquisition cost (CAC). |

## Summary

The Career Navigator can transform from a diagnostic tool to a future-oriented career resilience platform. By:

1. Reducing friction through instant value delivery
2. Incentivizing CV uploads through personalized insights
3. Creating viral growth through social sharing

We can simultaneously:

- Increase user engagement
- Improve data quality
- Reduce acquisition costs
- Serve strategic government LMI needs

This is Product-Led Growth in action—where user value and business value are perfectly aligned.
