## 📋 Overview

This repository showcases a **product strategy proposal** for **Whiteshield's Career Navigator**, a labor market intelligence tool designed to help mid-level professionals navigate AI disruption and career transitions.

**The Challenge:** High user friction due to diagnostic-first UX — users must provide extensive data (CVs, skills) before receiving value.

**The Solution:** Shift from past-oriented skill assessment to future-oriented economic mobility through a 3-feature PLG (Product-Led Growth) funnel that incentivizes data contribution.

---

## 🎯 Strategic Focus

### The Target Persona
**Mid-level professionals with informed anxiety**
- 3-7 years experience in AI-exposed sectors
- Digitally literate but lack technical depth or leadership moat
- Consume labor market news but struggle with signal-to-noise ratio
- Want personalized, actionable direction for skill investment

---

## 💡 Key Insights

### 1. **The Value Gap**
Current architecture creates high friction:
```
User Journey Today:
Provide Data (CV, skills, attitudes) → Wait → Receive Generic Assessment
❌ High effort, delayed value
```

### 2. **The Future-Oriented Value Proposition**
Proposed user journey:
```
Optimized Journey:
Input Job Title → Instant Risk Score → Upload CV → Get Personalized Roadmap → Share Badge
✅ Immediate value, progressive engagement
```
